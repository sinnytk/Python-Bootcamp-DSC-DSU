Paste questions and brief writeup here

in the first program i have read every charachter. i have assumed every position as in matrix and then print every char in their respective positions such as charat(0) at (0,0), charat(1) at (1,1) and so on on their respective positions. PLus for some styling i have, from colorama import Fore,Style. In the second program, i have created a dictionary of lists and by running through loop i have printed every value in the table in the third program using split function, first i spilited whole song in small fragment putting them in list and then looping over each index to print them.Plus used time.sleep function to delay the execution of each line.
