## Assignments

1. Define a function to print a string diagonally, for example:

   Tarun will be printed as:

Optional (recommended):

- Try printing reverse diagonal as well.


### Solution
- for printing characters diagonaly i create a loop which have range of user input then i add spaces at each itration   then the character of user input

2. Create a program to take as input 5 student records in the following format:

```
**roll_num** | **name** | **age** | **marks**(out of 100)
```

And then output the records in a tabular form with class average, class highest and class lowest at end in the following format.

- Use dictionaries (list of dictionaries in exact)
- Insert atleast 5 records
- Input must be user-given
- (Optional) validate the user input, i.e marks aren't greater 100 and other such validations you think there might be

3. A function that will print lyrics of given song with 1 second delay between each line.

   - Use time.sleep()
   - Use split() function of string

### Solution
-store a song in a song variable then split it at every part which has , then print all the parts at 1 sec delay

Note:

- You can use main function to predefine anything but make sure you divide everything you can in functions.
- Submit your github folder link and your output on Google Classroom
- Make sure you fork [https://github.com/sinnytk/Python-Bootcamp-DSC-DSU](https://github.com/sinnytk/Python-Bootcamp-DSC-DSU), clone the repo locally and create your scripts in the respective week's folder and push it.
- Make sure in each folder there's a [readme.md](http://readme.md) file with code output and brief explanation of what you did and why you did it (not necessary, but good practice)
